🤖 Laurimate – Pepper Robot Campus Assistant
Final Interaction & UI Concept


1. Core Design Principle

Laurimate is designed as a voice-first social robot.

Pepper primarily listens and speaks, while text input is provided as an optional fallback, not the main interaction.

This preserves:

natural human–robot communication

Pepper’s social character

accessibility in noisy or quiet environments




2. Welcome Screen & Idle State

Visual Design

Full-screen minimal interface

Soft animated background
Laurimate logo

Behavior

Pepper faces the user

Subtle idle animation

“Hello! I’m Laurimate, your campus assistant.”




User can:


start speaking by tapping on start and 

Central voice bubble (slow breathing animation) appears

laurimate will write listening




3. Language Selection (Global Control)
Placement

Top-right corner

Flag icons:

🇬🇧 English

🇫🇮 Finnish

🇸🇪 Swedish

Effect

Changing language updates:

speech recognition language

voice output language

on-screen text captions

Language can be changed at any time.




4. Primary Interaction Mode: Voice (Default)
UI Layout

Large animated voice bubble in the center

Small microphone icon inside the bubble

Live transcribed text shown below the bubble

Bubble States & Animations
State	Description
Idle	Slow pulse (breathing)
Listening	Expanding sound waves
Thinking	Rotating dots
Speaking	Pulse synchronized with voice
Voice Input Flow

User speaks naturally

Bubble reacts to sound

Recognized speech appears as live text:

“wifi password”

Listening stops automatically

Processing Logic

Campus JSON knowledge searched first

If information exists → direct answer

If not → AI fallback (Gemini)

This ensures:

accuracy

speed

responsible AI usage

Voice Output Flow

Pepper speaks the response using robot TTS

Bubble animates while speaking

Caption text appears below for clarity

Example:

“Use the Eduroam network. Log in with your Laurea email.”




5. Optional Typing Mode (Secondary, Hidden)

Typing is not a separate mode — it is a temporary UI overlay.

Access

Small ⌨️ keyboard icon in the corner

Visible but unobtrusive

Used when:

speech recognition fails

environment is noisy

user prefers typing





6. Typing Mode UI (ChatGPT / Messenger Style)
Design

Clean chat interface

Speech-bubble layout:

User messages on right

Laurimate messages on left

Typing indicator:

animated three dots (…) while processing

Behavior

User types a question

Message appears instantly

Typing dots show while thinking

Pepper still speaks the reply

Text reply appears simultaneously

Typing does not disable voice output.

Example Flow (Typing Mode)

User types:

“Who made you?”

Typing dots appear…

Pepper replies (voice + text):

“I was made by Rakesh and Prasiddha.”



7. Switching Back to Voice Mode

Keyboard can be closed anytime with the cross button 

Keyboard will go down on closing & UI smoothly transitions back to voice bubble

No session reset required.

Voice interaction remains continuous.




8. Accessibility & UX Considerations

Voice-first interaction supports natural communication.

Text captions improve accessibility.

Typing fallback supports:

hearing-impaired users

international students

noisy or silent spaces

Minimal UI keeps focus on Pepper, not the tablet



9. Idle & Recovery Behavior

After inactivity:

bubble returns to the start animation

Pepper softly says:

“I’m here if you need help.”

If speech not recognized:

“Sorry, could you repeat that?”

Keyboard option remains available at all times in the corner

10. Concept Summary (One-Sentence Pitch)


Laurimate is a multilingual, voice-first campus assistant for the Pepper robot that provides accurate university information through natural speech interaction, with an optional chat-style typing interface as a fallback.
